Want to custom craft your own packets? Scapy can do that. Need to perform an action after receiving a certain type of packet? Scapy can do that. Want to send out a packet and record the response? Scapy will definitely do that too!\r\n\r\nNot only is scapy powerful, but it's built right on top of the functionality of Python! Use your favorite Python modules to help with all this crazy packet work you'll be doing. Python's control and conditional statements will give you the flexibility to make network tools that will wow!\r\n\r\n### What we are going to cover\r\n\r\n  1. Python + scapy overview\r\n  2.
